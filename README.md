# Inspiration <br>
This project was inspired by the disasters, such as the wild fires, floods and other severe weather conditions that have caused massive damage to locations in the tropical regions like the Amazon.

# What it does <br>
Tropics provides an interactive globe in which the user can spend time exploring conditions in different areas around the world. This application can be of use to the general public and researchers

# How we built it <br>
The app with using Flask, Python, React, HTML, and CSS.

# Challenges we ran into <br>
* Failure to find access to data using restricted APIs. 
* Integrating the FE and BE. 
* Using external UI libraries and customizing to fit our needs.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of  <br>
* Proud of completing the two main pages of the app including add-ons like email and SMS notifications.
* Good team work throughout.
* Learning new skills

# What we learned  <br>
* Had to learn React and we were able to complete the project with it
* Learnt more about weather forecasts and predictions
* Learnt about running different servers on different ports on the same machine

# What's next for Tropics  <br>
Having a live site that allows users to explore more areas and provide insights for a more focused location and expand locations more. Also we'd like to provide more information for the location selected.
